# Soya

## Hopefully hassle free web front-end framework

Soya uses React, Webpack and Redux to help speed up web front-end engineering efforts. Soya aims to:

- Make it easier for front-end engineers to create and share UI components, as easy Java engineers import classes!
- Reuse components on any layer of abstraction, just the view, the domain logic, or the entire component - along with its context.
- Removes the need to deal with HTML, CSS, JS and static file dependencies manually.
- Easier to code by running the same view code on server and client side.

Eventually the final objective is to make the cost of web UI prototyping as small as possible, making iterative development of front-end much more viable.

Soya is still in active development. If you want to look around, play around in our integration tests.

    (~/soya) $ cd test/integration
    (~/soya/test/integration) $ npm install
    (~/soya/test/integration) $ npm run start

Server should be running at localhost:8000.
